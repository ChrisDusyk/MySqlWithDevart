I have used [Devart's dotConnect for Oracle](https://www.devart.com/dotconnect/oracle/), and I have found it to be excellent. Its support for Entity Framework 6 code-first has been very good, and it massively simplified the setup. So, I would like to try it out for MySQL as well. For this sample, I'm using the Devart dotConnect for MySQL Professional trial.

## What you need
- Visual Studio 2013+ (I used Visual Studio 2015 Community)
- Devart dotConnect for MySQL ([download here](https://www.devart.com/dotconnect/mysql/download.html)) 
- Any MySQL server variant (I'm using an instance of [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) on Amazon RDS)

The rest of the tutorial instructions are located on my [blog](http://dev-blog.dusyk.ca/using-devart-dotconnect-for-mysql/), or on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/LordCheese/MySqlWithDevart/wiki).
